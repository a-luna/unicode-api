                <p>For example, the character encoding scheme ASCII comprises 128 code points in the range <code>00-7F</code>, Extended ASCII comprises 256 code points in the range <code>00-FF</code>, and Unicode comprises 1,114,112 code points in the range <code>0000-10FFFF</code>.

        <div>
            <p>Unicode, being a unifying character set, contains characters that allow similar results to be expressed in different ways. Given that similar text can be written in different ways, we have a problem. How can we determine if two strings are equal ? How can we find a substring in a string?</p>
            <p>The answer is to convert the string to a well-known form, a process known as <strong>normalization</strong>. Unicode normalization is a set of rules based on tables and algorithms. It defines two kinds of normalization equivalence: <strong>canonical</strong> and <strong>compatible</strong>.</p>
            <p>Code point sequences that are defined as <strong>canonically equivalent</strong> are assumed to have the same appearance and meaning when printed or displayed. For example, "‚Ñ´" (<code>U+212B ANGSTROM SIGN</code>) is canonically equivalent to <strong>BOTH</strong> "√Ö" (<code>U+00C5 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH RING ABOVE</code>) and "A" (<code>U+00C5 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A</code>) + "‚óåÃä" (<code>U+030A COMBINING RING ABOVE</code>).</p>
            <p>Code point sequences that are defined as <strong>compatible</strong> are assumed to have possibly distinct appearances, but the same meaning in some contexts. An example of this could be representations of the decimal digit 6: "‚Ö•" (<code>U+2165 ROMAN NUMERAL SIX</code>) and "‚ë•" (<code>U+2465 CIRCLED DIGIT SIX</code>). In one particular sense they are the same, but there are many other qualities that are different between then.</p>
            <p>Compatible equivalence is a superset of canonical equivalence. In other words each canonical mapping is also a compatible one, but not the other way around.</p>
            <p><strong>Composition</strong> is the process of combining marks with base letters (multiple code points are replaced by single points whenever possible). <strong>Decomposition</strong> is the process of taking already composed characters apart (single code points are split into multiple ones). Both processes are recursive.</p>
            <p>An additional difficulty is that the normalized ordering of multiple consecutive combining marks must be defined. This is done using a concept called the Canonical Combining Class or CCC, a Unicode character property (available as the <strong>combiningClass</strong> property in the <strong>Basic</strong> property group).</p>
            <p>When you take all of these concepts into consideration, four normalization forms are defined:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>NFD</code>&nbsp;&nbsp;Canonical decomposition and ordering</li>
                <li><code>NFC</code>&nbsp;&nbsp;Composition after canonical decomposition and ordering</li>
                <li><code>NFKD</code>&nbsp;Compatible decomposition and ordering</li>
                <li><code>NFKC</code>&nbsp;Composition after compatible decomposition and ordering</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In an effort to make the process of normalizing/determining if a string is already normalized less tedious and complex, four ‚Äúquick check‚Äù properties exist for each character (<strong>NFD_QC</strong>, <strong>NFC_QC</strong>, <strong>NFKD_QC</strong>, and <strong>NFKC_QC</strong>, one for each normalization form).</p>
            <p>These properties allow implementations to quickly determine whether a string is in a particular Normalization Form. This is, in general, many times faster than normalizing and then comparing.</p>

            <p>The properties in this group include the pronunciations for a given character in Mandarin, Cantonese, Japanese, Sino-Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese.</p>
            <p>Any attempt at providing a reading or set of readings for a character is bound to be fraught with difficulty, because the readings will vary over time and from place to place, even within a language. Mandarin is the official language of both the PRC and Taiwan (with some differences between the two) and is the primary language over much of northern and central China, with vast differences from place to place. Even Cantonese, the modern language covered by the Unihan database with the least geographical range, is spoken throughout Guangdong Province and in much of neighboring Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, and covers four large urban centers (Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Macao, and Hong Kong). There are therefore distinct regional variations in pronunciation and vocabulary.</p>
            <p>Indeed, even the same speaker will pronounce the same word differently depending on the speaker or even the social context. This is particularly true for languages such as Cantonese, where there has been comparatively little government effort to standardize the language.</p>
            <p>Add to this the fact that in none of these languages‚Äîthe various forms of Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese‚Äîis the syllable the fundamental unit of the language. As in the West, it‚Äôs the word, and the pronunciation of a character is tied to the word of which it is a part. In Chinese (followed by Vietnamese and Korean), the rule is one ideograph/one syllable, with most words written using multiple ideographs. In most cases, an ideograph has only one reading (or only one important reading), but there are numerous exceptions.</p>
            <p>In Japanese, the situation is enormously more complex. Japanese has two pronunciation systems, one derived from Chinese (the on pronunciation, or Sino-Japanese), and the other from Japanese (the kun pronunciation).</p>
            <p>The on readings derive from Chinese loan-words. They depend on factors such as when (and from which part of China) the loan-word was borrowed, and changes to Japanese since then. On readings can therefore have little obvious relationship to modern Chinese readings, and the same Chinese reading for a given kanji can be reflected in multiple on readings in Japanese. Contrary to Chinese practice, on readings may be polysyllabic.</p>
            <p>Kun readings, on the other hand, derive from native Japanese words for which either existing kanji were adopted or new kanji coined.</p>
            <p>The net result is that multiple readings are the rule for Japanese kanji. These multiple readings may bear no relationship to one another and are highly context-sensitive. Even a native Japanese reader may not know the correct pronunciation of a proper noun if it is written only in kanji.</p>

            <dd>Boolean value that indicates whether the character belongs to a small class of visible format controls, which precede and then span a sequence of other characters, usually digits.

                <p>They are encoded in the range üá¶ (<code>U+1F1E6 <span>REGIONAL INDICATOR SYMBOL LETTER A</span></code>) to üáø (<code>U+1F1FF <span>REGIONAL INDICATOR SYMBOL LETTER Z</span></code>) Within the <strong>Enclosed Alphanumeric Supplement</strong> block in the <strong>Supplementary Multilingual Plane.</strong></p>
                <p>These were defined as an alternative to encoding separate characters for each country flag. Although they can be displayed as Roman letters, it is intended that implementations may choose to display them in other ways, such as by using national flags.</p>
                <p>For example, since the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code for Ukraine is <code>UA</code>, when the characters üá∫ (<code>U+1F1FA</code>) and üá¶ (<code>U+1F1E6</code>) are placed next to eachother the Ukrainian flag should be rendered: üá∫üá¶.</p>
